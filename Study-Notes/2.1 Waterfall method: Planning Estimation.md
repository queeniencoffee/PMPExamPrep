# PMP Planning Estimation Methods (Big Four)

This note summarizes the **four main estimating methods** you need to know for the PMP exam:

1. Analogous Estimating  
2. Parametric Estimating  
3. Three-Point Estimating (PERT / Triangular)  
4. Bottom-Up Estimating  

---

## 1. Analogous Estimating (“Top-Down” / Expert-Based)

**Definition:**  
Estimate **by comparison** with a **similar past project or activity**.

> Example: “The last mobile app login feature took 20 days; this one is similar, so estimate ~20 days.”

**When to use:**

- Early in the project (concept / feasibility)  
- When **limited detail** is available  
- For **Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)** estimates  

**Advantages:**

- Fast and simple  
- Useful with limited data  

**Disadvantages:**

- Less accurate  
- Heavily dependent on expert judgment and similarity of past work  

**Exam cue:**  
Phrases like *“based on a similar previous project,” “historical data from a similar project,” “top-down estimate”* → **Analogous estimating**.

## 2. Parametric Estimating (Formula-Based / Model-Based)

**Definition:**  
Use a **statistical or mathematical relationship** between variables to calculate an estimate.

> Example:  
> - Cost = **Rate × Quantity**  
> - \$1,000 per module × 10 modules = \$10,000  

**Typical examples:**

- \$X per square meter of construction  
- Y hours per use case / story / drawing  
- Cost per kilometer of road  
- Productivity rate (e.g., forms per hour, lines of code per month)

**Advantages:**

- More **data-driven** than analogous  
- Scales well when the rate/parameter is known  
- Can be **quite accurate** when based on strong historical data

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires **reliable historical data**  
- Relationship must be valid (e.g., linear or well-modeled)

**Exam cue:**  
Phrases like *“cost per unit,” “hours per item,” “rate × quantity,” “productivity factor multiplied by scope”* → **Parametric estimating**.

## 3. Three-Point Estimating (PERT / Triangular)

**Definition:**  
Use **three estimates** to account for uncertainty:

- **O** = Optimistic (best case)  
- **M** = Most Likely  
- **P** = Pessimistic (worst case)

Two common formulas:

1. **Triangular Distribution (simple average):**

\[
E = \frac{O + M + P}{3}
\]

2. **Beta / PERT Distribution (weighted average):**

\[
E = \frac{O + 4M + P}{6}
\]

(Here, the **Most Likely** estimate gets more weight.)

You can also calculate **standard deviation** for risk/uncertainty:

\[
\sigma = \frac{P - O}{6}
\]

**Advantages:**

- Explicitly accounts for **uncertainty and risk**  
- Produces a more **realistic expected value** than a single-point estimate  

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires effort to determine O, M, and P  
- Assumes the underlying distribution is reasonable  

**Exam cue:**  
Phrases like *“optimistic, most likely, pessimistic,” “three estimates,” “PERT,” “expected duration using O, M, P”* → **Three-Point estimating**.

## 4. Bottom-Up Estimating

**Definition:**  
Estimate at the **lowest level** (activity or work package) and then **aggregate upward** to obtain totals.

> Example: Estimate each task in the WBS, then sum them to get the project duration or cost.

**Steps:**

1. Break work down using a **WBS** or detailed backlog.  
2. Estimate cost and/or duration for **each work package or activity**.  
3. **Roll up** (sum) estimates to higher levels (control accounts, phases, entire project).

**Advantages:**

- Often the **most accurate** method when scope is well-defined  
- Provides detailed understanding for planning and control  

**Disadvantages:**

- Time-consuming and labor-intensive  
- Requires a **stable, detailed scope** and WBS

**Exam cue:**  
Phrases like *“estimate each work package and aggregate,” “roll up the estimates,” “detailed activity-level estimates”* → **Bottom-Up estimating**.

## 5. Super-Short Memory Aid

Use this for quick recall in the exam:

- **Analogous** – “Similar past project, expert judgment, **fast but rough**.”  
- **Parametric** – “**Rate × Quantity**, formula based on historical data.”  
- **Three-Point** – “O / M / P → expected value (PERT), **handles uncertainty**.”  
- **Bottom-Up** – “Estimate every small piece, then **sum up**; **most accurate, most effort**.”

| Method                    | Core Idea                                 | Data Needed                          | Accuracy         | Typical Use Case                                    |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Analogous**             | Compare to similar past project/activity  | High-level historical data + experts | Low–Medium       | Early rough estimates, little detail available     |
| **Parametric**            | Use rate × quantity formula               | Reliable historical rates/parameters | Medium–High      | Scalable estimating (units, modules, meters, etc.) |
| **Three-Point (PERT)**   | O/M/P -> expected value                   | 3 estimates per activity (O, M, P)   | Medium–High      | Risk-aware estimating with uncertainty             |
| **Bottom-Up**            | Estimate each detail, then roll up        | Detailed WBS/backlog                 | High (most accurate) | Detailed planning; stable and well-defined scope   |
