## 1. Agile Big Picture

**Agile = adaptive, value-driven, and change-friendly.**

Core ideas (Agile Manifesto values):

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
- Working software (product) over comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
- Responding to change over following a plan  

Agile emphasizes:

- Early and frequent delivery of value  
- Frequent feedback from customers and stakeholders  
- Embracing change, even late in development  
- Self-organizing, cross-functional teams  

---

## 2. Agile Life Cycles

### Predictive

- Plan-driven (“waterfall”).  
- Scope is fixed; time and cost estimated.  
- Best when requirements are stable and well-known.

### Iterative

- Build the solution in **cycles**.  
- Focus on refining the design or understanding over time.  
- Final delivery comes after several iterations.

### Incremental

- Deliver **usable pieces** (increments) of the product frequently.  
- Each increment adds functionality, and can be released.

### Agile (Iterative + Incremental)

- Both design and delivery evolve over short iterations.  
- Each iteration produces a usable increment **and** refines understanding.

### Hybrid

- Combination of predictive and adaptive approaches.  
- Example: Construction (predictive) + software (Agile).

**Exam cues:**

- High uncertainty / frequent change → **Agile or Hybrid**  
- Stable scope / strong regulation → **Predictive or Hybrid**

---

## 3. Core Agile Frameworks

### Scrum (most common on PMP)

**Roles:**

- **Product Owner (PO)** – Owns backlog, priorities, and product value.  
- **Scrum Master** – Servant leader, removes impediments, coaches Scrum.  
- **Developers (Team Members)** – Cross-functional team delivering increments.

**Events:**

- Sprint (1–4 weeks)  
- Sprint Planning  
- Daily Scrum (stand-up)  
- Sprint Review  
- Sprint Retrospective  

**Artifacts:**

- Product Backlog  
- Sprint Backlog  
- Increment  

---

### Kanban

- Visualizes workflow using a **Kanban board**.  
- Limits **Work in Progress (WIP)**.  
- Focuses on **flow**, reducing bottlenecks, and optimizing cycle time.  
- No required timebox for iterations.

---

### Lean and Extreme Programming (XP)

- **Lean** – Eliminate waste, build quality in, optimize the whole.  
- **XP** – Strong engineering practices (TDD, pair programming, CI, refactoring, simple design).

---

## 4. Agile Teams and Leadership

- **Self-organizing** – Team decides *how* to do the work.  
- **Cross-functional** – Team has all skills needed to deliver increments.  
- **Servant leadership** – Leaders support, unblock, and coach rather than command.  
- **Generalizing specialists** – Team members with broad skills and one or more deep specialties.

**Exam angle:** In Agile, the PM behaves more like a **servant leader / coach**, not a task-assigning boss.

---

## 5. Agile Planning Layers

Agile still plans, just in layers with **rolling-wave planning**:

1. **Vision / Product Strategy**  
2. **Product Roadmap** – Major features/epics over time  
3. **Release / Program Increment Planning** – What features in upcoming release  
4. **Iteration / Sprint Planning** – Stories for the next sprint  
5. **Daily Planning** – Adjustments via Daily Scrum

**Progressive elaboration:**  
Plans are refined and detailed as work gets closer.

---

## 6. Work Item Hierarchy

- **Epic** – Very large initiative; spans multiple releases.  
- **Feature** – Customer-facing capability; composed of multiple stories.  
- **User Story** – Small requirement that fits in a sprint.  
  - Format: *As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit].*  
  - Use **INVEST**: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.  
- **Task** – Technical step to implement a story.

Complementary concepts:

- **Acceptance criteria** – Conditions to accept a story/feature.  
- **Definition of Ready (DoR)** – When an item is ready to be pulled into a sprint.  
- **Definition of Done (DoD)** – Shared quality bar for “done” increments.

---

## 7. Events, Artifacts, and Metrics

### Key Scrum Events

- **Sprint Planning** – Define sprint goal and select stories.  
- **Daily Scrum** – Inspect progress and adapt the plan; team-level, not status to PM.  
- **Backlog Refinement** – Ongoing; clarify, split, and size backlog items.  
- **Sprint Review** – Demonstrate increment; collect feedback from stakeholders.  
- **Sprint Retrospective** – Improve process, tools, and relationships.

### Key Artifacts and Metrics

- **Product Backlog** – Ordered list of all work for the product (owned by PO).  
- **Sprint Backlog** – Sprint goal, selected stories, and tasks (owned by team).  
- **Increment** – Potentially shippable product at sprint end.

Metrics:

- **Burn-down chart** – Work remaining vs. time (often sprint-level).  
- **Burn-up chart** – Work completed vs. total scope (shows scope change).  
- **Cumulative flow diagram (CFD)** – Items in each workflow state over time (shows flow and bottlenecks).

---

## 8. Estimation and Forecasting

- **Relative estimation** – Compare items to each other, not to hours.  
- **Story points** – Abstract measure of size/complexity/uncertainty.  
- **Velocity** – Story points completed per iteration (team-specific).

Estimation techniques:

- Planning poker  
- T-shirt sizing  
- Affinity estimating  

Forecasting:

- Use historical velocity + remaining backlog to forecast release dates or number of sprints.  
- Do **not** use velocity to compare teams or judge individual performance.

---

## 9. Quality, Risk, and Technical Practices

**Build quality in:**

- Testing integrated into each iteration  
- Automated tests and continuous integration  
- Refactoring and managing **technical debt**

Key practices:

- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** – Write unit tests before code (Red-Green-Refactor).  
- **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)** – Define behavior in Given–When–Then scenarios.  
- **ATDD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development)** – Define acceptance tests before implementation.  
- **Spikes** – Time-boxed research or prototyping to reduce uncertainty.

Risk handling in Agile:

- Prioritize high-risk items earlier.  
- Short feedback loops (sprints, reviews, retrospectives).  
- Frequent delivery reduces overall risk.

---

## 10. Stakeholders, Communication, and Governance

- **Frequent stakeholder engagement** via reviews, demos, and workshops.  
- **Information radiators** – Visible boards and charts that show status and flow.  
- **Osmotic communication** – Informal knowledge transfer in co-located teams.  
- **Just enough documentation** – Only what is needed for understanding and maintenance.

Governance:

- Agile still tracks **budget, schedule, and scope**, but focuses on:
  - Value delivered  
  - Predictability (sustainable pace, stable velocity)  
  - Quality and customer satisfaction  

---

## 11. Agile Contracts and Procurement

Common contract patterns in Agile:

- **Time and materials (T&M)** – Often with a cap.  
- **Fixed-price with change mechanisms** – Allows scope evolution.  
- **Agile-friendly structures**:
  - Pay-per-iteration  
  - Pay-per-feature  
  - Target cost with shared savings / pain-gain share

Focus on:

- Collaboration over strict change control.  
- Shared risk and flexible scope within budget/time constraints.

---

## 12. Scaling and Hybrid Agile

**Scaling Agile:**

- One product, multiple Agile teams.  
- Patterns and frameworks:
  - Scrum of Scrums  
  - SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)  
  - LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)  
  - Nexus  

**Hybrid Agile:**

- Use predictive for stable, well-known components.  
- Use Agile for uncertain or evolving components.  

Example:  
Predictive for physical infrastructure; Agile for software and analytics.

---

## 13. Exam Tips for Agile Questions

- Watch for **environment cues**:
  - “High uncertainty,” “need for fast feedback,” “requirements changing” → Agile / Hybrid.  
  - “Strict regulatory compliance,” “fixed scope,” “contracts defined early” → Predictive / Hybrid.

- For **team questions**:
  - Favor self-organization, servant leadership, transparency, and collaboration.  

- For **conflict or issues**:
  - Facilitate conversation, coach, and empower the team.  
  - Use retrospectives and continuous improvement, not command-and-control.
