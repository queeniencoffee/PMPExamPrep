## Agile Core Methods
### 1. Scrum
- A single team management framework for management product development.
- The Scrum team consists of:
  -  Production Owner = customer, grow user stores for Kanban board
  -  Development Team = Deelops and tests the product. 
  -  Scrum Master = Responsible for ensuring the scrum processes (i.e. standup and retrospectives), removing blockers. 

### Scrum Events and Artifacts Definitions: 

| # | Events |                      Definition                       |
|---|--------| ----------------------------------------------------- | 
| 1 | Sprint | A time-boxed project "iteration" of two to four weeks |
| 2 | Sprint Planning | At the start of each sprint, the scrum team selects the highest priority items. |
| 3 | Daily Scrum | A short (15 minutes) standup meeting to walk through project tasks (often on a Kanban board). |
| 4 | Sprint Review | The development team gives a demo on the product to the product owner for sign-off (or rework or change) |
| 5 | Sprint Retrospective | A retrospective at the end of the sprint, to improve the way of work for the next iteration. |

| # | Artifacts |                      Definition                    |
