## Agile Core Methods
### 1. Scrum
- A single team management framework for management product development.
- The Scrum team consists of:
  -  Production Owner = customer, grow user stores for Kanban board
  -  Development Team = Deelops and tests the product. 
  -  Scrum Master = Responsible for ensuring the scrum processes (i.e. standup and retrospectives), removing blockers. 

### Scrum Events and Artifacts Definitions: 

| # | Events |                      Definition                       |
|---|--------| ----------------------------------------------------- | 
| 1 | Sprint | A time-boxed project "iteration" of two to four weeks |
| 2 | Sprint Planning | At the start of each sprint, the scrum team selects the highest priority items. |
| 3 | Daily Scrum | A short (15 minutes) standup meeting to walk through project tasks (often on a Kanban board). |
| 4 | Sprint Review | The development team gives a demo on the product to the product owner for sign-off (or rework or change) |
| 5 | Sprint Retrospective | A retrospective at the end of the sprint, to improve the way of work for the next iteration. |

| # | Artifacts |                      Definition                    |
|---|--------| ----------------------------------------------------- | 
| 1 | Product Backlog | The **product owner** manages a <ins>prioritized list of planned product items</ins> which evolves from sprint to sprint. |
| 2 | Sprint Backlog | The items selected in **Sprint Planning** for the upcoming sprint. |
| 3 | Increments | The Increment is all the Product Backlog items completed uring a Sprint - a step towards the main version or goal. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Kanban
- "Sign-board"' from the Toyota Production System
- Kanban = Visual Sign in japanese
- It is a form of visual management from Lean manufacturing, for monitoring **Work in Progress**, and enabling "Pull" and "Flow".
- **Pull** is where people or team "pull" work only when they are ready, instead of work or inventory building up.
- **Flow** is where work flows effortlessly through the value chain, with no rework.

#### Differences between "Kanban" and "Scrum": 
- Kanban does not prescribe "iterations", but works very well with them (i.e. Scrum).
- It is helpful when you need:
  - increased efficiency
    - Visbility of each task and ensuring it adds value. 
  - Team member focus
    - Limited work in progress allows the team to focus on the current work. 
  - Variability in the workload
  - Reducetion of waste
    - Transparency makes waste visble so it an be removed. 

- The board acts as an **information radiator** to anyone who sees it, providing up-to-date information on the status of work to the team. 

| # | Defining Principles      |   Core properties                                     |
|---|--------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- | 
| 1 | Start with current state | Visualize the workflow                                |
| 2 | Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change | Limit work in progress        |
| 3 | Respect the current process | Manage Flow                                        |
| 4 | Lead at all levels       | Enable "Pull"                                         |
| 5 |                          | Make process policies explicit                        |
| 6 |                          | Implement feedback loops                              |
| 7 |                          | Improve collaboratively                               |

### eXtreme Programming (XP)
- a software development method based on frequent cycles, known for poplarizing a lolistic set of 12 primary practices (later expanded to other secondary practices).

| XP Practice Area | Primary Practices | Secondary Practices |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| **Organisational** | Sit together<br>Whole Team<br>Informative workspace | Real customer involvement<br>Team continuity<br>Sustainable pace |
| **Technical** | Pair programming<br>Test-first programming<br>Incremental design | Shared code / collective ownership<br>Documentation from code and tests<br>Refactoring |
| **Planning** | User stories<br>Weekly cycle<br>Quarterly cycle<br>Slack | Root cause analysis<br>Shrinking teams<br>Pay per use<br>Negotiated scope contract<br>Daily stand-ups |
| **Integration** | 10-minute build<br>Continuous Integration<br>Test-first | Single code base<br>Incremental deployment<br>Daily deployment |
