# The Agile Manifesto and Mindset

## Life Cycle Selection
### Where does Agile fit in Product and Project Management? 

#### Use "Waterfall" when: 
1. Definable: Clear Procedures, similar to past projects
   i.e. Production of a car, appliance or home after the design is completed
2. High-Uncertainty:  High rates of changes, complexity and risk
   i.e. System or problem solving engineers, product designers, doctors, lawyers

## The Four Agile Values

| # |   The Agile Four Values        | over |    Waterfall                 |
|----|-------------------------------| ---- |---------------------------- |
| 1 | Individuals and interactions   | over | Processes and Tools         |
| 2 | Working Software               | over | Comprehensive documentation |
| 3 | Customer collaboration         | over | Contract Negotiation        |
| 4 | Responding to change           | over | Following a Plan            |

The Agile Manifesto argues that although the concepts on the right have value, those on the left have greater value.
