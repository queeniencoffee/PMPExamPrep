## The Four Agile Values & Manifesto

| # |   The Agile Four Values        | over |    Waterfall                 |
|----|-------------------------------| ---- |---------------------------- |
| 1 | Individuals and interactions   | over | Processes and Tools         |
| 2 | Working Software               | over | Comprehensive documentation |
| 3 | Customer collaboration         | over | Contract Negotiation        |
| 4 | Responding to change           | over | Following a Plan            |

The Agile Manifesto argues that although the concepts on the right have value, those on the left have greater value.

## The Agile 12 Clarifying Principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
   2-4 weeks, incremental delivery, put feedback back to the products
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
   Get regular feedback through iteration, then make changes to the products if necessary intead of one change toward the end.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Whole Team approach
- The whoel team approach meaning involving everyone with the knowledge and skills necessary to ensure project success.
- The team should be "relative small" (successful teams have been observed with as few as three people and as many as nine).
- Ideally, the whole

## Early and Frequent Feedback
- Agile projects have short iterations enabling the project team to receive early and continuous feedback on product quality throughout the development lifecycle.
- By getting frequency customer feedback as teh project progresses, Agile teams can incorporate most new changes into the product, and the development process.

## The benefit of early and frequency feedback include: 
- Avoid requirements misundersatndings, which may not have been detected until alter in the development cycle when they are more expensive to fix.
- Clarifying customer feature requests, makign them availble for customer use early.  This way, the product better reflects what the customer wants.
- Discovering (via continuous integraiton), isolating, and resolving quality problems early.  Providing information to the Agile team regarding its productivity and ability to deliver.
- Promoting consistent project momentum.

## Life Cycle Selection

### Where does Agile fit in Product and Project Management? 

#### Use "Waterfall" when: 
1. Definable: Clear Procedures, similar to past projects
   i.e. Production of a car, appliance or home after the design is completed
2. High-Uncertainty:  High rates of changes, complexity and risk
   i.e. System or problem solving engineers, product designers, doctors, lawyers
