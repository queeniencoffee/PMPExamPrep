# Day 4 - Section 7:  Introduction to Traditional Predictive Project Management

## Video 71 - Introduction to the Process Groups

The video outlines the 49 processes defined in the "Process Groups: A Practice Guide" by PMI and emphasizes the difference between predictive and adaptive project management.    Defined Scope: It explains that predictive projects maintain a defined scope throughout execution, making them suitable for large, fixed projects, such as skyscrapers.
### Five Process Groups:
        Initiating: Key processes include developing the project charter and identifying stakeholders.
        Planning: This group consists of 24 processes that form a comprehensive project management plan for managing scope, budget, and resources.
        Executing: Involves 10 processes focused on carrying out project work.
        Monitoring and Controlling: Comprises 11 processes that ensure the project aligns with the initial budget, schedule, and scope.
        Closing: Encompasses the formal completion of the project.

Complexity Reassurance: The instructor reassures students that although the processes may seem complex, they will be explained in detail throughout the course, highlighting their importance for effective project management.

Other key highlights:  Traditional v.s. Agile v.s. incremental v.s. iterative

## Video 72 - 49 Process of Traditional Project Management

### Objective: 
This provides a comprehensive introduction to the 49 processes used in traditional project management, especially for predictive projects. Here are the key highlights:

<b>- Understanding Over Memorization: </b> 
The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the processes conceptually rather than just memorizing them, as applying these concepts is crucial for real-life project management and exam success.<br>
<b>- Reference to PMBOK Guides:</b> The lecture references the PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, which details these processes, and mentions the transition to the PMBOK Guide Seventh Edition, which takes a more generic approach and omits specific processes.<br>
<b>- Tailoring Processes: </b>While the 49 processes are considered best practices, they are not mandatory and should be tailored to meet the specific needs of individual projects. However, knowing them for the exam is critical.<br>
<b>- Introduction to ITTOs:</b> The concepts of Inputs, Tools, Techniques, and Outputs (ITTOs) associated with each process are introduced and will be explored further in the course.<br>
<b>- Categorization of Processes:</b> The processes are categorized into five Process Groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. The speaker highlights how many processes fall within each group and prepares learners for a deeper dive into each one.<br>

Overall, Video 72 aims to equip learners with the necessary knowledge to manage projects effectively and succeed in project management examinations.
