# Day 4 - Section 7:  Introduction to Traditional Predictive Project Management

## Video 71 - Introduction to the Process Groups

The video outlines the 49 processes defined in the "Process Groups: A Practice Guide" by PMI and emphasizes the difference between predictive and adaptive project management.    Defined Scope: It explains that predictive projects maintain a defined scope throughout execution, making them suitable for large, fixed projects, such as skyscrapers.
### Five Process Groups:
        Initiating: Key processes include developing the project charter and identifying stakeholders.
        Planning: This group consists of 24 processes that form a comprehensive project management plan for managing scope, budget, and resources.
        Executing: Involves 10 processes focused on carrying out project work.
        Monitoring and Controlling: Comprises 11 processes that ensure the project aligns with the initial budget, schedule, and scope.
        Closing: Encompasses the formal completion of the project.

Complexity Reassurance: The instructor reassures students that although the processes may seem complex, they will be explained in detail throughout the course, highlighting their importance for effective project management.

Other key highlights:  Traditional v.s. Agile v.s. incremental v.s. iterative

## Video 72 - 49 Process of Traditional Project Management

### Objective: 
This provides a comprehensive introduction to the 49 processes used in traditional project management, especially for predictive projects. Here are the key highlights:

<b>- Understanding Over Memorization: </b> 
The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the processes conceptually rather than just memorizing them, as applying these concepts is crucial for real-life project management and exam success.<br>
<b>- Reference to PMBOK Guides:</b> The lecture references the PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, which details these processes, and mentions the transition to the PMBOK Guide Seventh Edition, which takes a more generic approach and omits specific processes.<br>
<b>- Tailoring Processes: </b>While the 49 processes are considered best practices, they are not mandatory and should be tailored to meet the specific needs of individual projects. However, knowing them for the exam is critical.<br>
<b>- Introduction to ITTOs:</b> The concepts of Inputs, Tools, Techniques, and Outputs (ITTOs) associated with each process are introduced and will be explored further in the course.<br>
<b>- Categorization of Processes:</b> The processes are categorized into five Process Groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. The speaker highlights how many processes fall within each group and prepares learners for a deeper dive into each one.<br>

Overall, Video 72 aims to equip learners with the necessary knowledge to manage projects effectively and succeed in project management examinations.

## Video 73 - 5 Process Groups

Video 73 provides an introduction to the 49 processes utilized in managing predictive projects, focusing on understanding these processes rather than memorizing them. Here are the key highlights:

<b>- Conceptual Focus:</b> The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding the processes conceptually for both real-life application and exam preparation. It's not necessary to memorize them in-depth but to be able to identify key processes when discussed.<br>
<b>- Historical Context:</b> The video references the PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition, highlighting that the outlined processes are still relevant and used today for predictive projects. This historical view helps learners recognize the continuity in project management principles.<br>
<b>- Understanding ITTOs:</b> The importance of Inputs, Tools, Techniques, and Outputs (ITTOs) associated with each process is introduced, setting the stage for deeper exploration in later sections of the course.<br>
<b>- Project Management Plan as Input:</b> A critical point made is that the project management plan serves as an input to many of the processes, functioning as a comprehensive document that guides execution, monitoring, controlling, and planning.<br>

Overall, Video 73 aims to prepare students for a thorough exploration of the 49 processes, urging them to focus on understanding rather than rote memorization, which can be beneficial for effective project management practice and exam success.

## Video 74 - Processes ITTO's

Video 74 focuses on the 33 project documents as defined by the PMBOK Guide, which are crucial for the PMP exam. Here are the key highlights:

<b>- Understanding Project Documents:</b> The instructor emphasizes that it's essential to have a thorough understanding of all 33 project documents listed in the PMBOK Guide. Knowing where they are created and what they contain is vital for exam preparation.<br>
<b>- Document Overview:</b> A PDF resource is provided in the course that outlines all 33 documents, including where each document is created in the project management processes and a brief description of their purpose.<br>
<b>- Key Examples:</b> The video mentions specific documents such as the Team Charter, highlighting that it is created during the Plan Resource Management process. This practical connection helps learners grasp the real-world application of each document.<br>
<b>- Memory and Understanding:</b> Students are encouraged to memorize the documents but also to understand their meaning and usage, as exam questions may require differentiating between these documents.<br>

Overall, Video 74 serves as a preparatory resource for mastering the project documents essential for the PMP exam, combining memorization with comprehension to support effective learning and application.
