3. Compromise / Reconcile
4. Force / Direct
5. Collaborate / Problem Solve

Incorporating multiple viewpoints and insights from differing perspectives; typically leads to consensus and commitment. This approach can result in a win-win situation. 

## Negotiation Techniques

| Technique                     | Description |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Never Say Yes to the First Offer** | There is often even a little room to move from someone’s opening offer. Ask nicely, with a smile. |
| **Bracketing**               | Open your offer an equal distance from where you want to end up – e.g. if you want 10 resources and they offer 8, say you need 12 (10 is in the middle). |
| **Higher Authority**         | Beware of others using a partner, committee, boss or other “higher authority.” They can say no and make it difficult to get a decision. |
| **Never Split the Difference** | If someone offers to split the difference, their new “offer” is that amount. If you split the difference twice, you have given up more than you intended. |
| **Pivot to Non-Monetary Terms** | Can you offer or negotiate on non-monetary terms, like extra days, other resources, or other inclusions? |
| **Deadlines and Time Pressure** | Always “test” a deadline given – check if it’s really true with a hypothetical statement. 80% of concessions are given in the last 20% of the time. |
| **Position for Acceptance**  | Make it easy for the other person by conceding something (like non-monetary terms) to reduce the impact on their ego so they don’t feel they are “losing.” |
