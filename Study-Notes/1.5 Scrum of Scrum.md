## 1. Scrum of Scrums (SoS)

### Purpose

**Scrum of Scrums** is a **coordination meeting across multiple Scrum teams** working on the same product, program, or value stream.

Think of it as a **“stand-up of teams”**, not individuals.

### When to Use

- You have **several Scrum teams** (e.g., 4–10+) working on:
  - One product
  - One large program
  - One shared release
- There are significant:
  - **Cross-team dependencies**
  - **Integration risks**
  - Shared milestones or components

### Who Attends

- **1–2 representatives per team**:
  - Often a **Scrum Master** and/or a **technical representative (developer)**.
- Sometimes a **chief Scrum Master** (or Release Train Engineer in SAFe) facilitates.

### Typical Focus / Questions

At Scrum of Scrums, each team answers **at the team level**:

1. What did our team complete that impacts other teams?  
2. What will our team do next that others should know about?  
3. What **impediments or risks** could affect other teams?  
4. What **dependencies** do we have on other teams (and vice versa)?

### Key PMP Points

- SoS is a **scaling mechanism for Scrum** (multi-team coordination).  
- It is **time-boxed** (e.g., 15–30 minutes).  
- Focus is on **integration, dependencies, and overall progress**, not micro-level status.  
- Fits into **scaled Agile / hybrid** contexts.

## 2. Relative Estimation

### Concept

**Relative estimation** compares work items to each other instead of trying to estimate absolute time.

> “Story B is roughly twice as big as Story A”  
> rather than “Story B will take 16 hours.”

Used with **story points** and **collaborative estimation** techniques.

### Steps

1. **Choose a baseline story**
   - Example: “User login” = moderate complexity.
   - Team agrees: **5 story points**.

2. **Compare other stories to the baseline**
   - Story A: “Update profile” → smaller than login → **3 points**.  
   - Story B: “Checkout with tax and discounts” → clearly bigger → **8 or 13 points**.

3. **Use a standard point scale**
   - Common: **Fibonacci-like**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40…
   - Larger numbers = **more complexity/uncertainty**.

4. **Use Planning Poker (exam term)**
   - Each team member secretly selects a point value card.  
   - All reveal their estimates **simultaneously**.  
   - Discuss differences, especially outliers.  
   - Vote again until the team reaches consensus.

### PMP Angle

- Faster and often more accurate than hour-based estimation.  
- Builds **shared understanding** and highlights uncertainty.  
- Underpins **velocity** and **release forecasting** in Agile.

## 3. Velocity

### Definition

**Velocity** is the amount of work a team completes in one iteration, usually measured in **story points**.

> Velocity = Sum of story points of all items that are **“Done”** in a sprint  
> (“Done” = meets the team’s **Definition of Done**; no partial credit)

### Example

Assume completed story points per sprint:

- Sprint 1: 18 points  
- Sprint 2: 22 points  
- Sprint 3: 20 points  
- Sprint 4: 24 points  

**Average velocity**:

- Total = 18 + 22 + 20 + 24 = 84  
- Average = 84 ÷ 4 = **21 points per sprint**

### How to Use Velocity

1. **Forecast # of sprints needed**

If product backlog has **126 points remaining**:

- Sprints needed ≈ 126 ÷ 21 = **6 sprints** (approx.)

2. **Capacity-based sprint planning**

- If velocity ~21, but one member is on vacation:
  - Team may plan for **15–17 points** instead of 21.

### PMP Cautions

- Velocity is **team-specific**, not for comparing teams.  
- Do **not** use velocity for **individual performance evaluation**.  
- Velocity stabilizes over time when:
  - Team composition is stable.  
  - Definition of Done is consistent.  
  - Estimation practices remain consistent.

## 4. Burn-Down Chart

### Purpose

A **burn-down chart** shows **remaining work over time** for a sprint or release.

- Helps the team see if they are **on track** to finish the planned work by the end of the timebox.

### Axes

- **X-axis:** Time (e.g., sprint days).  
- **Y-axis:** Remaining work (e.g., story points, tasks, or hours).

### How to Build (Sprint Burn-Down Example)

Assumptions:

- Sprint length: **10 working days**.  
- Total work at start: **40 story points**.

1. **Ideal line** (optional but common)
   - Day 0: 40 points.  
   - Day 10: 0 points.  
   - Ideal daily burn: 40 ÷ 10 = **4 points/day**.

2. **Actual line**
   - Each day, sum the **remaining** story points (not done) and plot.

Example (remaining work at day’s end):

- Day 0: 40  
- Day 1: 38  
- Day 2: 35  
- Day 3: 30  
- Day 4: 28  
- …  
- Day 10: 0 (if all work completed)

### Interpreting Burn-Down

- Line **above** ideal → team may be **behind schedule**.  
- Line **below** ideal → team may be **ahead of schedule**.  
- Flat line → **no progress** (possible impediments).  
- Upward jump in remaining work → **scope added** (if being tracked).

## 5. Burn-Up Chart

### Purpose

A **burn-up chart** shows **work completed over time** and highlights **scope changes**.

Often easier for stakeholders to interpret than a burn-down.

### Axes

- **X-axis:** Time (days or sprints).  
- **Y-axis:** Work amount (e.g., story points, features).

### Lines

1. **Total Scope Line**
   - Represents total planned work.  
   - Adjusts if scope increases or decreases.

2. **Completed Work Line**
   - Starts at 0.  
   - Increases as more work is completed (cumulative).

### Example

Release with evolving scope:

- Day 0: Total scope = 100 pts; Completed = 0.  
- End Sprint 1: Scope = 100; Completed = 20.  
- End Sprint 2: Scope increases to 120; Completed = 45.  
- End Sprint 3: Scope = 120; Completed = 70.  
- End Sprint 4: Scope = 120; Completed = 120 (all done).

### Why Burn-Up is Useful

- **Scope changes are explicit** (total scope line moves).  
- You can distinguish:
  - Slow progress vs  
  - Increased scope causing delays.

**PMP nuance:** Burn-up charts are strong tools for **stakeholder communication** because they clearly show **both progress and scope changes**.

## 6. How These Fit Together (Exam View)

- **Relative Estimation** → Assign **story points** by comparison.  
- **Velocity** → Average story points completed per sprint.  
- **Burn-Down** → Visualize **remaining work**; are we on track?  
- **Burn-Up** → Visualize **completed work vs total scope**; see progress and scope changes.  
- **Scrum of Scrums** → Coordinate multiple teams’ progress, dependencies, and impediments across a **shared product or release**.

These are **core Agile measurement and scaling concepts** that frequently appear in PMP exam questions involving:

- Forecasting  
- Progress tracking  
- Multi-team coordination  
- Communicating status to stakeholders
