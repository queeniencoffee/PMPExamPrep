------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Agile Core Methods
## 1. Scrum
- A single team management framework for management product development.
- The Scrum team consists of:
  -  Production Owner = customer, grow user stores for Kanban board
  -  Development Team = Deelops and tests the product. 
  -  Scrum Master = Responsible for ensuring the scrum processes (i.e. standup and retrospectives), removing blockers. 

### Scrum Events and Artifacts Definitions: 

| # | Events |                      Definition                       |
|---|--------| ----------------------------------------------------- | 
| 1 | Sprint | A time-boxed project "iteration" of two to four weeks |
| 2 | Sprint Planning | At the start of each sprint, the scrum team selects the highest priority items. |
| 3 | Daily Scrum | A short (15 minutes) standup meeting to walk through project tasks (often on a Kanban board). |
| 4 | Sprint Review | The development team gives a demo on the product to the product owner for sign-off (or rework or change) |
| 5 | Sprint Retrospective | A retrospective at the end of the sprint, to improve the way of work for the next iteration. |

| # | Artifacts |                      Definition                    |
|---|--------| ----------------------------------------------------- | 
| 1 | Product Backlog | The **product owner** manages a <ins>prioritized list of planned product items</ins> which evolves from sprint to sprint. |
| 2 | Sprint Backlog | The items selected in **Sprint Planning** for the upcoming sprint. |
| 3 | Increments | The Increment is all the Product Backlog items completed uring a Sprint - a step towards the main version or goal. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Kanban
- "Sign-board"' from the Toyota Production System
- Kanban = Visual Sign in japanese
- It is a form of visual management from Lean manufacturing, for monitoring **Work in Progress**, and enabling "Pull" and "Flow".
- **Pull** is where people or team "pull" work only when they are ready, instead of work or inventory building up.
- **Flow** is where work flows effortlessly through the value chain, with no rework.

### Differences between "Kanban" and "Scrum": 
- Kanban does not prescribe "iterations", but works very well with them (i.e. Scrum).
- It is helpful when you need:
  - increased efficiency
    - Visbility of each task and ensuring it adds value. 
  - Team member focus
    - Limited work in progress allows the team to focus on the current work. 
  - Variability in the workload
  - Reducetion of waste
    - Transparency makes waste visble so it an be removed. 

- The board acts as an **information radiator** to anyone who sees it, providing up-to-date information on the status of work to the team. 

| # | Defining Principles      |   Core properties                                     |
|---|--------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- | 
| 1 | Start with current state | Visualize the workflow                                |
| 2 | Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change | Limit work in progress        |
| 3 | Respect the current process | Manage Flow                                        |
| 4 | Lead at all levels       | Enable "Pull"                                         |
| 5 |                          | Make process policies explicit                        |
| 6 |                          | Implement feedback loops                              |
| 7 |                          | Improve collaboratively                               |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. eXtreme Programming (XP)
- a software development method based on frequent cycles, known for poplarizing a lolistic set of 12 primary practices (later expanded to other secondary practices).
- Lightweight, humanistic, discipline, software development.
- Often write tests to test it, Restructure often (see opportunity to improve it), talk to customer often and interact with customer. 

| XP Practice Area | Primary Practices | Secondary Practices |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| **Organisational** | Sit together<br>Whole Team<br>Informative workspace | Real customer involvement<br>Team continuity<br>Sustainable pace |
| **Technical** | Pair programming<br>Test-first programming<br>Incremental design | Shared code / collective ownership<br>Documentation from code and tests<br>Refactoring |
| **Planning** | User stories<br>Weekly cycle<br>Quarterly cycle<br>Slack | Root cause analysis<br>Shrinking teams<br>Pay per use<br>Negotiated scope contract<br>Daily stand-ups |
| **Integration** | 10-minute build<br>Continuous Integration<br>Test-first | Single code base<br>Incremental deployment<br>Daily deployment |

## 4. Feature Driven Development (FDD)
**"Iterative" & "Incremental" method**
- **Iterative** towards success, taking the feedback received, roll back into the product and improve over time --> Scrum, have a designated set of backlog which will be work iteratively over time. Features make up the backlog of work. 
- ""Incremental** Develop products and deliver to customer so customer can touch the products (maybe the features that we can look at) --> Kanban, is the way to manage that work.
   - It started with the backlog. Individual stories make up the features, individual features make up the products

Feature driven development (FDD) is an iterative model for developing software.  It focuses on: 
- Developing an overall model
- Building a features list
- Plan by those features
- Design by those features
- Build by those features


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Develop high-level model] --> B[Develop features list]
    B --> C[Plan by feature]
    C --> D["Design by feature<br/>'Set of storyboards make up a feature'"]
    D --> E["Build by feature<br/>'Take the feature, show to customer'"]
    E -->|Iterate after feedback<br/>'Gather feature feedback from customer'| A
```

# Agile Auxiliary Methods
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Scrum of Scrums

- **Scrum of Scrums**
  - Similar to Projects, Programs and Portfolios.
  - Conducted when **two or more teams** of three to nine members need to co-ordinate their work.

- **Attendance**
  - A representative from each team attends a meeting with other team representatives around **three times a week**.

- A represntative from each team attends a meeting with other team representative around 3 times a week, to report on:**
  - Completed work  
  - Next set of work  
  - Current blockers  
  - Potential upcoming blockers  

- **Goal**
  - Ensure teams are coordinating work.
  - Remove blockers across teams.

 ### Relationship with PMBOK Projects, Programs and Portfolios Concept:
Scrum of Scrums aligns well with the view of Projects, Programs, and Portfolios in the PMBOK Guide: 
![Scrum of Scrums](https://github.com/queeniencoffee/PMPExamPrep/blob/4512959b2137c6052cd0bde2961f3ea72abd30a1/Study-Notes/img/Scrum%20of%20Scrums.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

- SAFe focuses on a detailing practices, role and activities at the **portfolio, program and project levels**, and focuses on organizing the enterprise around <ins>value streams that provide value to the customer</ins>. 
- Principles: 
  - Take an economic view
  - Apply systems thinking --> how small piece fit into the bigger piece of the system
  - Assume variability, preserve options
  - Build <ins>incrementally</ins> with fast, integrated learning cycles
  - Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems
  - <ins>Visualize</ins> and limit work in progress, reduce batch sizes, manage queue lengths --> Kanban Board
  - Apply the cadence for synchronoizing with <ins>cross-domain planning</ins> --> Scrum of Scrums
  - Unlock the <ins>intrinsic motivation</ins> of knowledge workers
  - Decentralize decision making

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Crystal 
- This is a general guideline for "communication" and "interaction"
- Introduced by Alexander Cockburn in his book *Crystal Clear* and created at IBM in 1991, Crystal is an agile framework focusing on individuals and their interactions, as opposed to processes and tools (the first Agile principle). It is not a set process, but a guideline for team collaboration and communication.

### Three core beliefs
- Technologies change techniques  
- Cultures change norms  
- Distances change communication  (Prefer to be in the same location)

### Crystal Core values and Properties
- Crystal is designed to scale and recognises that each project may require a **slightly tailored** set of practices based on size and complexity.

| Core Values     | Common Properties                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| People          | Frequent delivery                                                            |
| Interaction     | Reflective improvement (Retrospective, taking feedback back to Scrum, 2-4 wks)|
| Community       | Close communication                                                          |
| Skills          | Personal safety                                                              |
| Talents         | Focus                                                                        |
| Communications  | Easy access to expert users   (Through Product Owner)                        |
|                 | Technical environment with automated tests, configuration management and frequent integration |

### Crystal is designed to scale
Crystal is designed to scale and realises that each project may require a slightly tailored set of practices based on size and complexity.

| Discretionary Money (D)  | D3                             | D10                               | D30                               | D80                             |
| Comfort (C)              | C3                             | C10                               | C30                               | C80                             |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
- Defining Stories and Features from customer POV
- "Whole team" is involve in this process
- Behaviour-driven development allows a developer to focus on testing the code based on the expected behaviour of the software. It is a method of writing user stories.

Specific behaviour-driven development frameworks can be used to define acceptance criteria based on the **given/when/then** format:

- **Given** some initial context,  
- **When** an event occurs,  
- **Then** ensure some outcomes.

```mermaid
graph LR
    G[Given] --> W[When] --> T[Then]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Disciplined Agile (DA)
- Disciplined Agile is a process decision framework that blends various Aile techniques based on teh following principles:
- Looking for Results over Process

| Principle                 | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| People First              | Enumerating roles and organisation elements at various levels       |
| Learning-oriented         | Encouraging collaborative improvement                               |
| Full delivery life-cycle  | Promoting several fit-for-purpose life cycles                       |
| Goal-driven               | Tailoring **processes** to achieve specific **outcomes**            |
| Enterprise awareness      | Offering guidance on **cross-departmental** governance              |
| Scalable                  | Covering multiple dimensions of program complexity                  |
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Agile Unified Profess (AUP)

The intent of AUP is to perform more iterative cycles across seven key disciplines, and incorporate the associated feedback before formal delivery.

| Discipline within a release | Principles guiding the disciplines           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Model                       | The team knows what it’s doing               |
| Implementation              | Simplicity                                   |
| Test                        | Agility                                      |
| Deployment                  | Focus on high-value activities (prioritizing backlog) | 
| Configuration management    | Tool independence                            |
| Project Management          | Tailoring to fit                             |
| Environment                 | Situationally specific                       |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Large Scale Scrum (LeSS)
- LeSS aims to organize several development teams towards a common goal by extending the Scrum method across teams.

| Similarities of LeSS and Scrum                                      | LeSS Techniques Added to Scrum                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One single product backlog                                          | Sprint planning is more formally divided into two parts – what and how.         |
| One definition of done for all teams                                | Organic cross-team coordination                                                  |
| One potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint | Overall cross-team refinement                                                   |
| One product owner                                                   | Overall retrospective focused on cross-team improvements                        |
| Complete, cross-functional teams                                    |                                                                                  |
| One sprint                                                          |                                                                                  |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Dynamic Systems Delivery Method (DSDM)

- DSDM was designed to add more rigour to the rising iterative methods of the 1990s. It is most known for its emphasis on constraint-driven delivery, which sets Cost, Quality and Time at the beginning, then uses formalised prioritisation of scope to meet those constraints.

![Dynamic Systems Delivery Method (DSDM)](https://github.com/queeniencoffee/PMPExamPrep/blob/0c792a242b8d4944327ce0d14f7ede7c2826b166/Study-Notes/img/Dynamic%20Systems%20Delivery%20Method%20(DSDM).png)

### Eight Principles of DSDM framework:

1. Focus on the business need  - deliver products every 2-4 weeks to customer
2. Deliver on time  
3. Collaborate  
4. Never compromise quality  
5. Build **incrementally** from firm foundations  
6. Develop **iteratively**  --> Customer can see what's going on 
7. Communicate continuously and early  (Agile Daily Standup)
8. **Demonstrate control** (use appropriate techniques, prioritisation of scope, etc)  --> Make sure customer can see it. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Enterprise Scrum

- Enterprise Scrum is a frmework designed to apply the Scrum method **at an organizational level**, not just a single product development effort.
- It advises leaders to:
  - Extend the use of Scrum across all aspects of the organization
  - Generalize the Scrum techniques to apply easily at those various levels
  - Scale the Scrum method with supplemental techniques as necesary
