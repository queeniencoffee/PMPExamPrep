## Topic 2:  EVM Formula & Terminology

📊 Project Performance Metrics: CPI & SPI

This document provides a quick reference guide to two critical project performance metrics used in **Earned Value Management (EVM)**:  
**Cost Performance Index (CPI)** and **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**.

---

## ✅ Cost Performance Index (CPI)

### 📌 Formula:
CPI = Earned Value (EV) / Actual Cost (AC)

### 📈 Interpretation:
| CPI Value     | Meaning               |
|---------------|------------------------|
| CPI = 1.0     | On budget              |
| CPI < 1.0     | Over budget            |
| CPI > 1.0     | Under budget (cost-efficient) |

### 📊 Example:
If **EV = $80,000** and **AC = $100,000**:
CPI = 80,000 / 100,000 = 0.80
