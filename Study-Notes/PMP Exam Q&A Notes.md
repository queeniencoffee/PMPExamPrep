## Topic 2:  EVM Formula & Terminology

📊 Project Performance Metrics: CPI & SPI

This document provides a quick reference guide to two critical project performance metrics used in **Earned Value Management (EVM)**:  
**Cost Performance Index (CPI)** and **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**.

---

## ✅ Cost Performance Index (CPI)

### 📌 Formula:
CPI = Earned Value (EV) / Actual Cost (AC)

### 📈 Interpretation:
| CPI Value     | Meaning               |
|---------------|------------------------|
| CPI = 1.0     | On budget              |
| CPI < 1.0     | Over budget            |
| CPI > 1.0     | Under budget (cost-efficient) |

### 📊 Example:
If **EV = $80,000** and **AC = $100,000**:
CPI = 80,000 / 100,000 = 0.80

## 📌 Risk Response Strategies (PMP / PMI-ACP)

In PMI terminology, these are **risk response strategies**.  
They differ for **threats (negative risks)** and **opportunities (positive risks)**.

---

## 1. Strategies for Threats (Negative Risks)

| Strategy  | Type   | Description                                                                 | Simple Example |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Avoid    | Threat | Change the plan so the risk **cannot occur**.                              | Remove risky scope or choose a different technology. |
| Mitigate | Threat | **Reduce the probability and/or impact** of the risk.                      | Add prototypes, extra testing, or training to lower the chance of failure. |
| Transfer | Threat | Shift the **impact/ownership** of the risk to a **third party** (usually by paying a fee). | Buy insurance, use warranties, or sign a fixed-price contract with a vendor. |
| Accept   | Threat | **Do nothing proactive** beyond monitoring; may set aside reserves.        | Acknowledge the risk and create a contingency budget if it occurs. |
| Escalate| Threat | Risk is **outside the project’s scope or authority**; send to higher level (program/portfolio). | Raise a regulatory or organizational risk to senior management. |

**Notes:**
- **Accept** can be:
  - **Passive accept** – acknowledge and monitor only.
  - **Active accept** – establish **contingency reserves** (time/cost).

---

## 2. Strategies for Opportunities (Positive Risks)

| Strategy | Type        | Description                                                              | Simple Example |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Exploit | Opportunity | Change the plan so the opportunity **definitely occurs**.                | Assign your best team so an early-finish opportunity is guaranteed. |
| Enhance | Opportunity | **Increase probability and/or impact** of the opportunity.               | Add resources or tools to make a performance gain more likely. |
| Share   | Opportunity | **Partner** with a third party to jointly realize the opportunity.       | Form a joint venture to enter a new market together. |
| Accept  | Opportunity | Take advantage **if it happens**, but **do not invest** to pursue it.    | Use extra capacity if a vendor delivers early, but don’t spend to accelerate them. |
| Escalate| Opportunity | Opportunity is better managed at **program/portfolio/organizational** level. | A strategic market opportunity passed to corporate leadership. |

## 3. Quick Exam Memory Aids

### Threats (Negative Risks)
> **A-M-T-A-E**  
> **A**void, **M**itigate, **T**ransfer, **A**ccept, **E**scalate

### Opportunities (Positive Risks)
> **E-E-S-A-E**  
> **E**xploit, **E**nhance, **S**hare, **A**ccept, **E**scalate

## 4. Exam Tips

- On PMP questions, always ask:
  1. Is this a **threat** or an **opportunity**?
  2. Is the PM **allowed to act**, or should the risk be **escalated**?
- If the goal is to **completely eliminate** a threat → think **Avoid**.  
- If the goal is to **reduce** probability/impact → think **Mitigate**.  
- If the goal is to **move impact to a third party** → think **Transfer**.  
- If the risk is **outside project authority** → think **Escalate** (threat or opportunity).

1. “Seven Basic Quality Tools” – key for quantifying quality

These are the ones you should immediately think of for Control Quality:

Check Sheet (Tally Sheet)

Collects frequency data on defects or issues (how many, how often, where).

Directly gives you numbers → defect counts, occurrences per shift, etc.

Histogram

Bar chart of how frequently values occur (e.g., defect size, processing time).

Shows distribution and helps see if results are within acceptable range.

Pareto Diagram (80/20 Chart)

Histogram sorted from largest to smallest with cumulative % line.

Quantifies which few defect types cause most of the problems.

Control Chart

Plots results over time with control limits and spec limits.

Used to see if a process is in control or showing special-cause variation.

Run Chart (sometimes grouped with control chart)

Trend over time; used to spot trends, shifts, or cycles in quality data.

Scatter Diagram

Plots two variables to see if there is a correlation (e.g., temp vs defects).

Helps quantify relationships (positive, negative, none).

Cause-and-Effect Diagram (Ishikawa/Fishbone)

Less “numeric,” but still used in quality control to analyze causes of defects.

Often used together with the numeric tools above.

You need to leverage CCB to help fix a problem. Typically you don't have to go to CCB, but because you are closing out the project, you can't change anymore so you MUST go through CCB to change it.

When it said it doesn't meet the "standards" --> this implies "Quality Planning". From PMBOK 6th edition

You need to leverage CCB to help fix a problem. Typically you don't have to go to CCB, but because you are closing out the project, you can't change anymore so you MUST go through CCB to change it. 

“confirm specifications / requirements have been met” → Control Quality
“obtain formal acceptance / sign-off / customer approval” → Validate (or Verify) Scope
