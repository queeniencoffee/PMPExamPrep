## Topic 1:  People
### Role and Responsibilities

1. Project Sponsors - Initiate the project through project charter, provides funding and / or resources, accepts the project deliverables.
2. Project Manager - Manges the project team to deliver the value
3. Business Analyst - Elicits customer and stakeholder requirements, ensure the solution matches those requirements.  
4. Project Team, Vendor, Seller - perform the work to deliver the value

## Conflict Management

There are 5 general techniques for resolving conflicts:  
1. Withdraw / Avoid
2. Smooth Accomodate
3. Compromise / Reconcile
4. Force / Direct
5. Collaborate / Problem Solve

Incorporating multiple viewpoints and insights from differing perspectives; typically leads to consensus and commitment. This approach can result in a win-win situation. 

## Negotiation Techniques

| Technique                     | Description |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Never Say Yes to the First Offer** | There is often even a little room to move from someone’s opening offer. Ask nicely, with a smile. |
| **Bracketing**               | Open your offer an equal distance from where you want to end up – e.g. if you want 10 resources and they offer 8, say you need 12 (10 is in the middle). |
| **Higher Authority**         | Beware of others using a partner, committee, boss or other “higher authority.” They can say no and make it difficult to get a decision. |
| **Never Split the Difference** | If someone offers to split the difference, their new “offer” is that amount. If you split the difference twice, you have given up more than you intended. |
| **Pivot to Non-Monetary Terms** | Can you offer or negotiate on non-monetary terms, like extra days, other resources, or other inclusions? |
| **Deadlines and Time Pressure** | Always “test” a deadline given – check if it’s really true with a hypothetical statement. 80% of concessions are given in the last 20% of the time. |
| **Position for Acceptance**  | Make it easy for the other person by conceding something (like non-monetary terms) to reduce the impact on their ego so they don’t feel they are “losing.” |

## Types of Leadership

| Leadership Style  | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Laissez-faire** | Hands-off approach, allows team to make own decisions                                          |
| **Transactional** | Management by exception, focus on achievements                                                 |
| **Servant leader**| Focuses on others’ growth, learning, development, autonomy, and well-being                     |
| **Transformational** | Inspirational motivation                                                                    |
| **Charismatic**   | High energy, self-confident, holds strong convictions                                          |
| **Interactional** | Combination of transactional, transformational, and charismatic styles                         |

## Facilitation & Meeting Management

**Meeting management includes:**

- Preparing and distributing the agenda  
- Ensuring that a representative for each key stakeholder group is invited  
- Ensuring the meetings start and finish at the published time  
- Staying on topic during the meeting  
- Managing expectations, issues, and conflicts during the meeting  
- Recording actions and assigning people responsible for their completion  

## Power vs Influence
![Power vs Influence Chart](https://github.com/queeniencoffee/PMPExamPrep/blob/9595eec68048ad9a799ec3a52243d936384fabcf/Study-Notes/img/power%20vs%20influence%20chart.jpg?raw=1)

## Motivation
- Motivation is providing a reason for someone to act.

- The project manager needs to be aware of:
  - **Student Syndrome**: people apply themselves only at the last possible moment before a deadline.
  - **Parkinson’s Law**: work expands to fill the time available for its completion.

- Teams are motivated by:
  - Empowering them to participate in decision making  
  - Encouraging them to work independently

## Organizational Theory

**Key theories:**

- Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
- Herzberg’s Theory of Motivation
- MacGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y
- Parkinson’s Law

People and team members typically need to meet these needs **from bottom to top** – if the previous level is not met, they can’t achieve the next level.

---

### Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (Project Context)

| Level (bottom → top)    | Description / Project Context                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physiological Needs** | A comfortable workplace, earning enough to live comfortably.                                  |
| **Safety Needs**        | A safe home and safe employment. Is the team feeling safe?                                    |
| **Love / Belonging**    | Friendship, family, relationships. Does my team feel like they belong?                        |
| **Esteem**              | Self-esteem, confidence, achievement, gaining the respect of others.                          |
| **Self Actualisation**  | Creativity, spontaneity, problem solving, lack of prejudice, and a sense of meaning/purpose. |

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is a psychology model that explains **what motivates people** by arranging human needs in a **priority “pyramid”**. The idea: people must satisfy more basic needs first before they’re strongly motivated by higher-level needs.

1. **Physiological Needs**
   * Basic survival: food, water, sleep, shelter, rest.
   * At work: a livable salary, reasonable hours, being physically comfortable enough to function.

2. **Safety Needs**
   * Security and stability: personal safety, health, job security, predictable environment.
   * At work: safe working conditions, clear policies, stable employment, not fearing sudden firing or harm.

3. **Love / Belonging Needs**
   * Social connection: friendships, family, feeling part of a group.
   * At work: feeling included on the team, good relationships with coworkers, not being isolated or excluded.

4. **Esteem Needs**
   * Respect and recognition: self-confidence, feeling capable, being valued by others.
   * At work: recognition for good performance, opportunities to take responsibility, feeling that your skills are respected.

5. **Self-Actualization Needs**
   * Fulfilling your potential: growth, creativity, purpose, personal development.
   * At work: challenging projects, autonomy, chances to learn, innovate, and do work that feels meaningful.

**Key idea:** if lower levels are not met (e.g., someone feels unsafe or can’t pay rent), it’s much harder for them to care about higher-level goals like recognition or personal growth.

### Herzberg’s Theory of Motivation

Herzberg’s Theory of Motivation is also called the **Two-Factor Theory**.
It explains **what makes people satisfied or dissatisfied at work** by splitting causes into two groups:

#### 1. Hygiene Factors (avoid dissatisfaction)

These don’t *motivate* people, but if they’re missing or bad, people become unhappy.

Typical hygiene factors:

* Salary and benefits
* Company policies and administration
* Working conditions (environment, tools, facilities)
* Job security
* Relationship with manager and coworkers
* Supervision quality

If hygiene factors are poor → **dissatisfaction**.
If they are good → people feel “not dissatisfied,” but **not necessarily motivated**.

#### 2. Motivators (create satisfaction)

These factors relate to the **work itself** and can truly motivate people and increase job satisfaction.

Typical motivators:
* Achievement
* Recognition for work done
* The work itself (interesting, challenging tasks)
* Responsibility and autonomy
* Advancement / promotion
* Personal growth and development

If motivators are present → **high satisfaction and motivation**.
If motivators are absent → people may feel neutral or bored, but not automatically “angry.”

---
 How this is used in project / people management
* First, **fix hygiene factors** so the team is not distracted or unhappy (fair pay, clear policies, decent tools, reasonable workload).
* Then, **add motivators**: give meaningful work, recognize contributions, increase responsibility, and provide growth opportunities.

So in short:
> **Hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction; motivators create satisfaction.**

### MacGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y

McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y describes **two opposite assumptions managers can hold about people at work**. Those assumptions strongly influence how they lead and control their teams.

---

### Theory X – pessimistic view

Manager’s assumptions:

* People **dislike work** and will avoid it if they can.
* Most people **must be directed, controlled, or coerced** to get them to work hard.
* People **prefer to be told what to do**, avoid responsibility, and want security above all.
* Motivation is mainly through **pay, supervision, and fear of punishment**.

Typical management style:

* Tight control and supervision
* Detailed rules, procedures, and micromanagement
* Little trust or delegation

---

### Theory Y – optimistic view

Manager’s assumptions:
* Work can be **as natural as play or rest** if conditions are right.
* People will **self-direct** and **self-control** when they are committed to objectives.
* Many people **seek responsibility** and want to contribute and grow.
* Creativity, imagination, and problem-solving ability are **widely distributed**, not rare.
* Motivation comes from **intrinsic factors**: achievement, recognition, meaningful work, growth.

Typical management style:
* Delegation and empowerment
* Participation in decision-making
* Focus on creating conditions where people can succeed and develop

#### Why it matters in projects
* A **Theory X** project manager tends to use command-and-control, heavy monitoring, and strict rules.
* A **Theory Y** project manager focuses on enabling, coaching, and trusting the team.

Most modern guidance (including Agile) leans toward **Theory Y** assumptions, especially for knowledge work—but in practice, managers often use a **mix** depending on the situation and team maturity.

---

### Parkinson’s Law
> **“Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.”**

In practice this means:

* If you give a task **2 weeks**, it will usually **take 2 weeks**, even if it could have been done in 3 days.
* People tend to **use up all the time** allocated — adding extra polishing, rework, or delays — simply because the deadline allows it.

### Why it matters for projects

* **Overly generous deadlines** can slow teams down.
* Tasks tend to **grow in complexity** and effort to match the time available.
* To counter it, project managers:

  * Set **realistic but tight deadlines**
  * Break work into **smaller tasks**
  * Use **frequent check-ins** or iterations instead of one far-off due date.

Agile: 
- Kanban board
- 3 Amigos - Customers, Developers, Testers
- Iteration Review:  A usable increment or feature should be ready - the team demonstrates this to the customer, who gives feedback and/or approves.
- Retrospective

## Business Environment 

### Prioritization 
- Cost / Benefit      BCR = Total Benefit of the project / Cost of the project 
- MoSCoW              M=Must have   S=Should have    C=Could have    W=will not have
- Multi-Voting        3 outcomes:  Unanimity (everyone agrees on the same course of action); Majority (more than 50% of people agree on a course of action); Plurality (the largest block agrees - even if they are not the majority). 
- Kano Analysis       Delighters: provide satisfaction where achieved fully, but do not cause dissatisfaction when not fulfilled.  Satisfers: provide sastisfaction when fulfilled and disatisfaction when not fulfilled.  Basic (when done well, customers are just neutral, but when done poorly, customers are very dissatisfied). 
- Cost of Delay       The cost of delay is the expected value of our feature, per a time period (i.e. weekly).  CD3 prioritize by the value of the item v.s. the time it will take to deliver. 
- WSJF                Weighted Shortest Job first
                      WSJF = Cost of Delay / Job Size
                          Where Cost of Delay is often broken into:
                          - User/Business Value
                          - Time Criticality
                          - Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement
                          Job Size is usually:
                          - Story points, effort, or relative size.
                          - You rank work by WSJF score (highest first).

    WSJF = Business Value + Urgency + Risk Reduction = COst of Delay / Job Size
    CD3 – Cost of Delay Divided by Duration
- ICE                  Impact, Confidence, Ease 
- Multi-Criteria Chart

## Value Measures 

1. Net Present Value (NPV)  = the Present Value (PV) of a future stream of payments, minus the Initial Investment Cost

    NPV = [ Total Future Cash Flow / (1 + % Return) ^ Number of time periods ] - Investment

    Investment:         $1000
    Current cash rate:  4% a year
    Cashflow:           $500 a year
    Number of years:    3 years

    NPV = [ $1500 / (1+0.04)^3 ] - $1000
    NPV = $1333 - $1000
    NPV = $333 (greater than zero = good start)

3. Internal Rate of Return  = the restulting return on your investment on given period. The **higher** the IRR the better.
   
   IRR = (Investment) * [ Total Future Cash Flow / (1 + % return) ^ Number of time period ] = 0 

    Investment:         $1000
    IRR:                TBA
    Cashflow:           $400 a year
    Number of years:    3 years

   IRR = [ $1200 / (1 + 0.0626) ^3 ] - $1000 = 0
   IRR = 6.26%
   
5. Return on Investment (ROI)    = a simple ratio that divides the net profit (or loss) from an investmetn by its cost. Because it is expressed as a percentage, it is easy to compare to different project investment choices. 

$2000 - $1000 / $1000 x 100 = 100%
$1500 - $1000 / $1000 x 100 = 50%

6. Payback Period           = payback period is the length of time it takes to breakeven on a project. 
Payback Period = Cost of Project / Average Annual Return 
**The shorter than payback period the better**

7. Benefit-Cost Ratio       = BCR compares the present value of all benefits with that of the cost of a project. 
BCR = Total benefit of the project / Cost of the project
