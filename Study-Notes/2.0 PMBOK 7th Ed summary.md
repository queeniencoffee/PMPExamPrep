## 2.1 How PMBOK 7 Fits into the PMP Exam

PMBOK 7 is **principle-based**, not a process checklist.

The PMP exam is based on:

- **Exam Content Outline (ECO)** – People / Process / Business Environment  
- **PMBOK 6** + **PMBOK 7 concepts** + **Agile Practice Guide**

Think of **PMBOK 7** as:

- A **mindset and principles** reference  
- A **value / outcome–focused** view of projects  
- A library of **models, methods, and artifacts** you can tailor to your context  

On the exam, PMBOK 7 shows up in questions around:

- **Value delivery**
- **Tailoring**
- **Complexity**
- **Systems thinking**
- **Principles-based behavior** rather than rigid steps

---

## 2.2 System for Value Delivery

PMBOK 7 describes how projects fit within a larger **value delivery system**:

> **Organization Strategy → Portfolios → Programs → Projects → Products/Outcomes**

**Goal:** Deliver **benefits and value**, not just “finish scope.”

### Key ideas

- Projects **enable change** and deliver **outcomes**.  
- **Value** is defined by **stakeholders and context**, not only the sponsor.  
- Project managers operate inside a **system of governance**:
  - Policies, oversight, controls, decision rights.  
- Projects operate in an environment:
  - **Internal** – culture, structure, systems, resource availability  
  - **External** – market, regulatory, social, technological  

> 💡 **Exam angle:** When a question asks about **benefits, value, or alignment to strategy** (not just “finish scope”), that’s PMBOK 7 thinking.

## 2.3 The 12 Project Management Principles

These are **behavioral guidelines**, not processes. You are expected to **apply** them in scenario questions.

1. **Stewardship**  
   Be a responsible steward of financial, human, environmental, and reputational resources.  
   - Ethics, integrity, compliance, sustainability.

2. **Team**  
   Build a collaborative, motivated, and respectful team environment.

4. **Value**  
   Focus on delivering **value and benefits**, not only outputs.  
   - Regularly ask: “Is this still valuable?” and recommend changes.

5. **Systems Thinking**  
   View the project as part of a **larger system**.  
   - Interdependencies, feedback loops, unintended consequences.

6. **Leadership**  
   Use **situational, service-oriented, and empowering** leadership.  
   - Adapt style; lead by example.

7. **Tailoring**  
   Adapt **methods, tools, and life cycle** to the project context.  
   - No “one size fits all.”

8. **Quality**  
   Build **quality into** processes and deliverables.  
   - Prevention > inspection; continuous improvement.

9. **Complexity**  
   Recognize and navigate technical, organizational, and social complexity.  
   - Use experimentation, simplification, feedback.

10. **Risk**  
    Address both **threats and opportunities**.  
    - Risk management is continuous and proactive.

11. **Adaptability & Resilience**  
    Be prepared to **adjust plans** and **bounce back** from setbacks.  
    - Flexibility under change and uncertainty.

12. **Change**  
    Accept that projects both **drive and experience change**.  
    - Manage impacts on people, processes, and the organization.

> 💡 **Exam tip:** Prefer answers that protect **value, stakeholders, quality, ethics** and show **tailoring, engagement, and learning**.

- Align approach to:
  - Requirements stability  
  - Risk level and uncertainty  
  - Need for feedback and speed  
  - Organizational environment

---

### 2.4.4 Planning Performance Domain

**Focus:** How you **plan**—as an **ongoing, evolving** activity.

## 2.5 Tailoring in PMBOK 7

**Tailoring** = customizing how you apply practices to a specific project.

### Tailoring steps (exam-friendly)

1. **Understand the context**  
   - Organization, culture, governance, regulations.

2. **Assess the project**  
   - Size, complexity, risk, uncertainty, stakeholders.

5. **Review and adapt continuously**  
   - Adjust tailoring when **conditions change**.

**Exam cues:**  
“What should the PM do first?” → **Assess context and needs before picking tools.**  
“One-size-fits-all” → usually wrong; **tailoring** is expected.

## 2.6 Models, Methods, and Artifacts

PMBOK 7 organizes tools into three buckets.

### 2.6.1 Models (Conceptual Lenses)

Examples:

- **Plan–Do–Check–Act (PDCA)**

---

### 2.6.2 Methods (Techniques / Practices)

Examples:

- Estimation: **analogous, parametric, three-point, bottom-up**  
- Scheduling: **critical path, Kanban, timeboxing**  
- Risk: **risk register, Monte Carlo, risk workshops**  
- Quality: **control charts, checklists, Pareto analysis**  
- Agile: **Scrum events, Kanban WIP limits, user stories**

**Use:** How you **actually execute** the work.

---

### 2.6.3 Artifacts (Documents / Deliverables)

Examples:

- Project charter

## 2.7 Key Mindset Shifts from PMBOK 6 to 7

PMBOK 7 introduces several important shifts:

- From **process compliance** → to **value and outcomes**  
- From **49 processes** → to **principles + domains + tailoring**  
- From **one methodology** → to **predictive + agile + hybrid**  
- From **project = deliverables** → to **project = change + benefits + value**  
- From **traditional PM only** → to **situational, context-based leadership**

> 💡 If an answer sounds **rigid, heavily process-obsessed, and not value-focused**, it’s usually **not** the best PMBOK 7–aligned choice.
