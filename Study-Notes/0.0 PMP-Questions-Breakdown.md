### PMP Question Outlook: 
1) Scenario-based questions, asking where something goes wrong.  
2) Goes in Multiple Choice:  A, B, C, D
3) We need to solve it using "Project Mangement" and "People skills
4) Two (2) or even three (3) answers will seem correct.
5) We must choose the MOST correct answer. 

## PMP Test Strategy: 
1.  Read the question and highlight all the keywords.
2.  Determine if the project is predictive, agile or hybrid.
3. Decide which topic or principle from PMBOK the question is addressing - whta the question is asking us to do.    
4. Strikethrough any answers that do not directly address the project methodology or PMBOK principle you identified.  
5.  Select one of the remaining questions.
6.  Make sure you answer every questions.  Flag the one you don't know.
7.  Knowing your timing.  You have:  230 minutes for 180 Questions --> 1 min 15 sec for each question
    60 questions: 155 minutes remain (10 min break)
    120 questions: 80 minutes remain (10 min break)
