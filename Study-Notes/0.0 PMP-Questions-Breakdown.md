## Breaks

For the **computer-based exam**, PMI allows:

- **Up to two (2) optional 10-minute breaks**
  - First break: after Question **60** (between Q60 and Q61)
  - Second break: after Question **120** (between Q120 and Q121)

Once you start a break, you **cannot** go back to the questions from the previous section.

---

## Pacing Strategy

You have **230 minutes** to answer **180 questions**.

Basic pacing math:

```text
230 minutes ÷ 180 questions ≈ 1.2777 minutes per question
≈ 1 minute 17 seconds per question
```

## Cover Topics: 

Predictive vs agile vs hybrid coverage (about half predictive, half agile/hybrid)

### PMI mindset

- Ethical, proactive, value-focused, stakeholder-centric
- Favor collaboration, coaching, prevention, continuous improvement

### PMP Question Outlook: 
1) Scenario-based questions, asking where something goes wrong.  
2) Goes in Multiple Choice:  A, B, C, D
3) We need to solve it using "Project Mangement" and "People skills
4) Two (2) or even three (3) answers will seem correct.
5) We must choose the MOST correct answer. 

## PMP Test Strategy: 
1.  Read the question and highlight all the keywords.
2.  Determine if the project is predictive, agile or hybrid.
3. Decide which topic or principle from PMBOK the question is addressing - whta the question is asking us to do.    
4. Strikethrough any answers that do not directly address the project methodology or PMBOK principle you identified.  
5.  Select one of the remaining questions.
6.  Make sure you answer every questions.  Flag the one you don't know.
7.  Knowing your timing.  You have:  230 minutes for 180 Questions --> 1 min 15 sec for each question
    60 questions: 155 minutes remain (10 min break)
    120 questions: 80 minutes remain (10 min break)

1. People
   - conflict
   - leadershhip
   - Power skills vs Business Acumen vs Ways of Working
  
     1a. Always **deliver value** , above everything else.
        Hints:   a) If answers say **"delay the project"** --> don't do it!  
                 b) Ultimate goal is to **deliver the project**, **deliver values**
                 c) if answers ask you to **add extra resources** --> don't do it! Make sure it's adding value!

     1b. Be **direct** and **collaborative** in your response.
        Hints:   a) **Go direct to the source of problem**
                 b) Don't be sneaky, **be collaborative**
     
     1c. Be **honest**, take responsibility and don't pass the buck.
        Hints: it's our responsiblility to handle it.
     
     1d. Problem solve, problem solve, problem solve.

     The process is:
     1. Define the problem
     2. Idnetify the Root Cause
     3. Brainstorm Solutions
     4. Choose the best one (priorize)
     5. Implement it
     6. Verify that it worked
        Plan --> Do --> Check --> Act (PDCA)

    >> Find and solve the root cause of the issue (before using any money).
    >> Make sure you're solving the right problem (i.e. team vs supplier - keywords in the question).
    >> If they use terms you are unfamiliar with (e.g. always-on Fishbowl window, marginal econimc analysis) revert to the quesito keywoards and solving the root cause of the problem.  

    1e.  Always go direct to the person, the team, or where the issue is.

   Use the right expertise:
   >> The team for their way of working, estimates on their work. 
   >> The customer for their requirements or product feedback.
   
   This is using **"Expert Judgement"** --> go directly to the expert! 

   1f. "Problem solve" **before** you escalate. 
   >> Collaborate with the Sponsor, but try and solve it first (be direct and collaborative)
   >> Do not suspend the project if you can help it (our ultimate aim is to deliver value)
   >> Do not add resources or delay items if you can help it (problem solve first). 

   1g. Understand conflict resolution types:
   >> Go for Problem Solve first, compromising next.
   >> Only Accomodate if there is an extreme power imbalance (e.g. Project Sponsor)
   >> Senior executives can influence other senior executives.
   
   Problem Solving:    Win / Win
   Compromising:       Lose / Lose
   Accomodating:       Lose / Win
   Forcing:            Win / Lose
   Withdraw / Avoid Conflict:  Not ideal.
