# PMP Study Strategy & Timeline

## 📚 Phase 1: Content Mastery (Start Now)

Focus on understanding the core concepts from the three PMP Exam Domains:

- **People – 42%**
- **Process – 50%**
- **Business Environment – 8%**

### 1. The PMP Eco-System

The current PMP exam is balanced across **predictive (waterfall)**, **agile**, and **hybrid** methodologies. You must understand how to apply project management principles in all these contexts.

- **Agile/Hybrid is Key**
  - Approximately **half of your exam** will be focused on agile and hybrid approaches.
  - Master the concepts in the **Agile Practice Guide** (Scrum, Kanban, XP, Lean).

- **Process Groups & Knowledge Areas (PMBOK Guide – 6th Edition)**
  - Even though the exam is organized by the three new domains, you still need to understand:
    - The **49 processes**
    - The **Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs (ITTOs)**
    - How they all relate across the five process groups and ten knowledge areas.

- **The PMP Mindset**
  - The PMP exam is a **scenario-based** test.
  - Answer questions based on **PMI best practices**, not just your personal work experience.
  - Always think:
    - *“What is the PM’s responsibility?”*
    - *“What is the next best thing to do?”*

### 2. Deep Dive Topics

Ensure you have a solid grasp of these high-frequency topics:

- **Risk Management**
  - Calculating **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)**
  - Understanding risk response strategies:
    - **Threats:** Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, Accept  
    - **Opportunities:** Exploit, Share, Enhance, Accept

- **Schedule Management**
  - **Critical Path Method (CPM)**
  - **Float / Slack**
  - Techniques:
    - **Crashing**
    - **Fast Tracking**

- **Cost Management**
  - **Earned Value Management (EVM)**
  - Memorize and understand the meaning and implications of key EVM formulas (see Phase 2).

- **Stakeholder & Communications Management**
  - Tailoring communication to audience and context
  - Managing stakeholder engagement levels
  - Understanding the **Communication Channels** formula


## 📝 Phase 2: Practice and Review (Core Focus)

Bridge the gap between **knowing the content** and **applying it under exam pressure**.

### 1. Practice Exams

The most critical study activity is taking **full-length, timed practice exams**.

- **Simulate the Real Exam**
  - The PMP exam is **180 questions over 230 minutes**.
  - Aim for **3–5 full-length mock exams** under realistic testing conditions.
  - This builds **stamina** and helps you **manage time** effectively.

- **Start with a Diagnostic Test**
  - Take an early practice test to identify your weakest domains:
    - People
    - Process
    - Business Environment
  - Use this to **tailor your study plan**.

- **Review, Review, Review**
  - The value is **not** in the score — it is in the **review process**.
  - For every question (right or wrong):
    - Read the explanation.
    - Understand **why** the correct answer is right.
    - Understand **why** the other options are wrong.
  - This reinforces the **PMI mindset**.

### 2. Formula Sheet (Brain Dump)

On test day, you will want to quickly jot down key formulas (EVM, communication channels, etc.).

- **Practice Writing Daily**
  - Create a “**brain dump**” sheet every day for a few minutes.
  - This reinforces memory and boosts confidence on exam day.

- **Key EVM Formulas**

  ```
  CV  (Cost Variance)              = EV - AC
  SV  (Schedule Variance)          = EV - PV
  CPI (Cost Performance Index)     = EV / AC
  SPI (Schedule Performance Index) = EV / PV
  ```

# Communication Channels & Final PMP Exam Countdown

## Communication Channels Formula

```text
Number of Channels = n (n - 1) / 2
where n = number of stakeholders

  
  EAC (Estimate At Completion)     = several variants depending on scenario
  VAC (Variance At Completion)     = BAC - EAC
```

## 🗓️ Phase 3: The Final Countdown (12/10 – 12/14)

### 12/10 – 12/12: Review and Final Practice

#### Focus on Weak Areas
- Review notes and flashcards for topics where you consistently scored low.
- Do **not** attempt to re-read the entire PMBOK Guide.

#### Review All ITTOs
- Do a final scan of the **49-process chart**.
- Focus on how **inputs** flow to **outputs** and the role of **tools & techniques**.

#### Final Full Exam
- Take one last **full-length practice test**.
- Target a score in the **mid-70% or higher** for confidence.

### 12/13 – 12/14: Light Review and Rest

#### 12/13 (Day Before Study Stop)
Perform a **high-level review only**:
- Formula sheet  
- Agile principles and values  
- **No new practice questions** today.

#### 12/14 (Study Stop Date)
**Stop studying completely.** This is non-negotiable.

Use the day to:
- Relax  
- Watch a movie  
- Exercise  
- Do anything that clears your mind  

Avoid cramming, which only increases **burnout and anxiety**.

- Route and parking/transport  
- Required ID documents  

Prepare:
- Lay out your clothes and any permitted items for the next day.

#### Mental Preparation
- Prioritize **sleep** and staying **calm**.
- Trust the work and preparation you have done.

### 12/16: Exam Day

- Eat a **solid breakfast**.
- Arrive at the test center **early**.

Use the two **10-minute breaks** (after questions 60 and 120) to:
- Stretch  
- Use the restroom  
- Reset your mind before returning to the exam  

During the exam, for each question:
- Read the **entire question** carefully.
