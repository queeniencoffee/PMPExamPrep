# **AR 30 Day – 60 Hour PMP Study Plan**

**Directions:**

* **Study for a minimum of 2 hours per day**.   
* Complete all Quick Quizzes at the end of each section.   
* This study plan is designed to take **1-2 months to complete.**  
* You can finish the entire certification in 1 month, but I recommend taking off 1-2 days per week.   
* It is outlined by day and what lessons to complete. Each day has about 2 hours of videos to watch or exams to complete.  
* I don’t recommend studying more than 2-3 hours per day. After about 2 hours we will forget many of the topics we learn earlier.   
* **Don’t study just to pass a test.** KEEP asking yourself, how can I apply this in a project I am doing now or in the future.

* REST – DO NOT STUDY  
* Wake up really early, I recommend 5AM. This way you can go to bed early that day and get a good night sleep. DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL or anything that may disturb your sleep.   
* Try not to be nervous. Keep in mind this is just a test, not something that is life or death. Accept that you might fail so keep your nerves calm. 

**Day 28 (JUDGEMENT DAY)**

* Wake up early.  
* Exercise to ensure you are awake.   
* **Dress in blue**.  
* Eat a well balance meal. Don’t drink too much coffee, but I recommend a small coffee.  
* Take Actual Certification. **Remember the mindset**.   
* When done you might get your results. If you pass, **Carrot cake and beer** or Cherry coke. If not, you might have to wait a day or so then celebrate.
