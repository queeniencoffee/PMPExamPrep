# PMP Exam Content Outline and Questions Breakdown

This repository documents the **PMP Exam Content Outline (ECO)**–based breakdown of questions and the guiding principles used to design PMP-aligned practice exams. It provides transparency into **domain coverage, question distribution, and exam philosophy**, ensuring alignment with PMI expectations.

## PMP Exam Content Outline (ECO) – Question Distribution

## Question Types in the PMP Exam

The PMP exam emphasizes **situational decision-making**, modern delivery approaches, and limited formula usage.

| Question Type | Questions | Percentage (%) | 
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Situational Questions | 180 | 100% |
| Agile / Hybrid | 93 | 50% | 
| Formula-Based Questions | 5 | 3% |

---

## Qualitative Alignment with the ECO

Our exams are designed to test **critical thinking and decision-making skills** in real-world project management scenarios.

Instead of emphasizing rote memorization of:
- Processes
- ITTOs (Inputs, Tools & Techniques, Outputs)

we focus on evaluating a candidate’s ability to:
- Interpret scenarios
- Analyze constraints
- Apply appropriate project management principles

This ensures readiness not just for the exam, but for professional practice.

---

## Mindset, Mindset, Mindset

Success in the PMP exam requires adopting the **“PMI way of thinking”**—a mindset aligned with PMI’s principles, which may differ from day-to-day project experiences.

Our questions are crafted to reinforce:

- Proactive problem-solving  
- Customer-focused decision-making  
- Ethical considerations in project management  
- Balancing competing constraints (scope, time, cost, quality, resources, risk)  
- Adapting leadership styles to different situations  
- Collaboration and team empowerment  

By practicing with mindset-driven questions, candidates develop the thinking patterns PMI expects.

> The PMP exam tests how PMI expects a project manager to think and act — not necessarily how things are always done in the real world.

---

## Style of Questions

Our practice exams closely reflect the **style and structure of real PMP questions**.

Most questions ask:
- *What should the project manager do?*
- *What should the project manager do first or next?*
- *Which tool or technique should be used?*

This helps candidates become comfortable with PMI’s wording and identify the **best possible answer**, not just a correct one.

---

## Test of Competency, Not Just Knowledge

The PMP exam evaluates **project management competency**, not memorization.

Our exams assess how effectively candidates can:
- Apply principles
- Make sound decisions
- Handle ambiguity
- Choose the most appropriate course of action

This ensures candidates are fully prepared for the **actual PMP exam experience**.
